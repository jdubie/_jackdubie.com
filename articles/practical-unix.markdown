[Sam King](http://samjk.blogspot.com/) teaches an awesome student initiated
course in the CS department named CS1U: Practical Unix. The class is great for
people that are just learning unix as well as people that have been developing
in unix for many years.

The lessons are broken up into short screencasts here,
[OpenClassroom](http://openclassroom.stanford.edu/MainFolder/CoursePage.php?course=PracticalUnix).
I refer back to this often to remember globbing syntax.

After watching these I started using [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) and eventually
started using [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).
